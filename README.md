## **CODSOFT Internships**

### **Overview**
This repository showcases the projects and tasks completed during two internships at CODSOFT: Python Programming and Artificial Intelligence. Each internship involved multiple tasks designed to enhance my skills and understanding in these fields.

### **Artificial Intelligence Internship**

**Task 1: Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses**
- **Objective:** Develop a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules.
- **Details:** Utilized if-else statements and pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This project introduced me to natural language processing and conversation flow basics, enabling the creation of an interactive rule-based chatbot.

**Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI**
- **Objective:** Implement an AI agent to play Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player.
- **Details:** Developed an AI using the Minimax algorithm, with and without Alpha-Beta Pruning, to create an unbeatable player. This task provided insights into game theory and basic search algorithms, enhancing my understanding of strategic AI development.

**Task 5: Face Detection and Recognition**
- **Objective:** Create an AI application for detecting and recognizing faces in images or videos.
- **Details:** Leveraged pre-trained face detection models such as Haar cascades and deep learning-based detectors. Added face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese networks and ArcFace. This project strengthened my skills in computer vision and facial recognition technologies.

### **Python Programming Internship**

**Task 1: To-Do List Application**
- **Objective:** Develop an application to help users manage and organize their tasks efficiently.
- **Details:** Created a command-line or GUI-based Python application that allows users to create, update, and track their to-do lists. This project aimed at enhancing productivity through efficient task management.

**Task 2: Simple Calculator**
- **Objective:** Design a calculator for basic arithmetic operations.
- **Details:** Prompted the user to input two numbers and an operation choice, performed the calculation, and displayed the result. This project reinforced fundamental programming concepts and user interaction.

**Task 3: Password Generator**
- **Objective:** Create a tool to generate strong and random passwords.
- **Details:** Built an application where users specify the desired password length and complexity. The generator uses a combination of random characters to produce a secure password and displays it on the screen. This task emphasized the importance of security and randomness in password generation.

**Task 4: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**
- **Objective:** Implement the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
- **Details:** Prompted user input, generated a random choice for the computer, and determined the winner based on game logic. Provided score tracking and an option to play multiple rounds. This project focused on implementing game logic and enhancing user experience.

**Task 5: Contact Information Management**
- **Objective:** Develop an application to store and manage contact information.
- **Details:** Allowed users to add, view, search, update, and delete contacts, with a user-friendly interface for interaction. This task involved creating a functional and accessible database application for managing personal contacts.

### **Conclusion**
The CODSOFT internships in Artificial Intelligence and Python Programming provided valuable hands-on experience with practical applications of AI techniques and Python programming. The tasks completed during these internships have significantly enhanced my technical skills and understanding in these domains.
